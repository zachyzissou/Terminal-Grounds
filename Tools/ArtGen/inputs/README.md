# ArtGen URL Downloads (Staging)

- Paste MCP result URLs into `url_batch_template.json` (copy to a new file if you want).
- Use strategic names in `name` so we can place later (e.g., `ui_icon_damage_ballistic_1024.png`).
- Run the downloader task to save files into `Tools/ArtGen/inputs/downloads/`.
- Later we can map these into UE import paths or `mcp_results.json`.

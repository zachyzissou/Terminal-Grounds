# Document Control Specialist - Agent Integration Guide

This guide explains how to integrate the Document Control Specialist into Terminal Grounds' existing agent ecosystem and workflow.

## Agent System Integration

### Adding to Claude's Agent Roster

The Document Control Specialist should be added to Claude Code's agent system with the following definition:

```text
- document-control-specialist: Use this agent when you need comprehensive documentation governance, version control, content auditing, or documentation architecture management for Terminal Grounds. This agent manages the 250+ markdown files across docs/, Tools/, Content/ and root directories, preventing documentation sprawl and ensuring consistency. Examples: 
  <example>Context: User notices duplicate or contradictory information across multiple documentation files. 
  user: 'I found three different asset generation guides with conflicting instructions. Can you help consolidate these?' 
  assistant: 'I'll use the document-control-specialist agent to audit the conflicting documentation, consolidate the accurate information, and establish a single source of truth with proper cross-references.' 
  <commentary>The user needs document governance to resolve conflicts and establish authoritative documentation.</commentary></example> 
  
  <example>Context: User wants to reorganize the growing documentation structure. 
  user: 'Our docs folder is getting unwieldy with overlapping content in different sections. Can you help restructure this?' 
  assistant: 'Let me engage the document-control-specialist agent to analyze the current documentation architecture and propose a streamlined organization with clear ownership and maintenance procedures.' 
  <commentary>The user needs expert document architecture to prevent further sprawl and establish sustainable governance.</commentary></example> 
  
  <example>Context: User needs to ensure documentation standards are maintained. 
  user: 'We keep creating documentation files without following any standards. Can you establish some governance?' 
  assistant: 'I'll use the document-control-specialist agent to create documentation standards, templates, and governance procedures that ensure consistency and prevent orphaned files.' 
  <commentary>The user needs systematic document control to establish maintainable documentation practices.</commentary></example> (Tools: *)
```

- **Workflow**: PE implements optimizations → DCS ensures docs capture learnings
- **Example**: DCS maintains documentation for ComfyUI performance tuning procedures

#### 4. DevOps Engineer
- **Synergy**: Process documentation and CI/CD integration
- **Workflow**: DevOps creates automation → DCS ensures process docs stay current
- **Example**: DCS integrates governance checks into PR workflow

## Workflow Integration Patterns

### 1. Proactive Governance

**When to Invoke DCS Proactively:**

```text
# After major system changes
user: "I just implemented the new territorial system. Can you help document it properly?"
→ Use document-control-specialist to create comprehensive docs with proper governance

# Before major releases  
user: "We're preparing for alpha release. Is our documentation ready?"
→ Use document-control-specialist to audit documentation completeness

# During architectural changes
user: "We're refactoring the asset pipeline. What docs need updating?"
→ Use document-control-specialist to identify impacted documentation
```

### 2. Reactive Problem Solving

**When Users Report Documentation Issues:**

```text
# Conflicting information
user: "I'm seeing different instructions for the same process in multiple places"
→ Use document-control-specialist to consolidate and establish single source of truth

# Missing documentation
user: "I can't find documentation for the new feature we implemented last month"
→ Use document-control-specialist to audit documentation gaps

# Outdated information
user: "Half our setup guides reference old versions of tools"
→ Use document-control-specialist to identify and update stale documentation
```

### 3. Maintenance Operations

**Regular Documentation Health Checks:**

```text
# Monthly governance audits
→ Use document-control-specialist for comprehensive health assessment

# Pre-PR documentation validation
→ Use document-control-specialist to ensure PR documentation is complete

# Post-sprint documentation cleanup
→ Use document-control-specialist to organize sprint artifacts
```

## Command-Line Integration

### PowerShell Commands (Windows)

```powershell
# Quick health check
.\Tools\DocumentControl\Run-DocumentAudit.ps1 -Summary

# Full audit with auto-fixes
.\Tools\DocumentControl\Run-DocumentAudit.ps1 -Audit -Fix

# Generate governance report  
.\Tools\DocumentControl\Run-DocumentAudit.ps1 -Audit -Report "monthly_governance.md"
```

### Python Direct Commands

```bash
# Comprehensive audit
python Tools/DocumentControl/document_control_specialist.py --audit

# Auto-fix with reporting
python Tools/DocumentControl/document_control_specialist.py --audit --fix --report governance_report.md
```

### Git Hook Integration

Add to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Documentation governance pre-commit check
python Tools/DocumentControl/document_control_specialist.py --audit --project-root .

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Documentation governance issues detected. Please review and fix."
    exit 1
fi
```

## Agent Collaboration Patterns

### 1. Multi-Agent Workflows

**Documentation Update Cascade:**

1. **CTO Architect** implements new system architecture
2. **Document Control Specialist** identifies documentation requiring updates  
3. **Performance Engineer** documents optimization procedures
4. **Document Control Specialist** validates cross-references and consistency
5. **DevOps Engineer** updates deployment documentation
6. **Document Control Specialist** performs final governance audit

### 2. Agent Handoff Protocols

**Asset Generation Documentation:**

```text
user: "Generate faction vehicle concepts and document the workflow"

1. comfyui-concept-designer: Generate vehicle assets
2. document-control-specialist: Create/update generation workflow documentation
3. document-control-specialist: Ensure proper cross-references to lore and art guides
4. document-control-specialist: Validate documentation follows Terminal Grounds standards
```

**System Implementation Documentation:**

```text  
user: "Implement territorial control system with full documentation"

1. cto-architect: Design system architecture
2. performance-engineer: Implement optimized components
3. document-control-specialist: Create comprehensive system documentation
4. document-control-specialist: Establish cross-references to related systems
5. document-control-specialist: Validate documentation completeness
```

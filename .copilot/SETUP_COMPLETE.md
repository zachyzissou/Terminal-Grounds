  - `document-control-specialist.json`

## 🚀 How to Activate

### Step 1: Configure VS Code Settings

1. Open VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"
3. Add this to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
    {
      "text": "Reference the Terminal Grounds project context from CLAUDE.md and use appropriate specialized modes when discussing technical, creative, or operational topics."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Use Mode-Specific Prompts

Activate any mode by starting your question with the mode name:

- **"CTO ARCHITECT MODE: How should we structure our server infrastructure?"**
- **"CHIEF ART DIRECTOR MODE: Review these faction emblems for consistency"**
- **"CHIEF DESIGN OFFICER MODE: Analyze our extraction mechanics"**
- **"And so on..."**

## 🎨 Mode Response Structures

Each mode follows its specialized Claude agent structure:

| Mode | Response Structure |
|------|-------------------|
| CTO Architect | Analysis → Recommendations → Architecture Sketches → Next Steps |
| Chief Art Director | Visual Analysis → Art Pillar Recommendations → Detailed Style Guides → Retcon Notes → Implementation Roadmap |
| Chief Design Officer | Analysis → Recommendations → System Details → Retcon Notes → Next Steps |
| Document Control Specialist | Documentation Analysis → Issue Identification → Governance Strategy → Implementation Plan |

## 🔧 Three-Option Framework

Most modes provide three recommendation types:

- **Safe:** Industry best practices, proven solutions
- **Bold:** Forward-leaning approaches with higher potential
- **Experimental:** Bleeding-edge solutions with higher risk

## 📋 Quick Test

Try asking Copilot:
**"CTO ARCHITECT MODE: Design a scalable architecture for our multiplayer extraction system"**

You should see responses structured as: Analysis → Recommendations → Architecture Sketches → Next Steps, with Safe/Bold/Experimental options.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Configure VS Code** using the settings above
2. **Test each mode** with relevant questions
3. **Customize instructions** in the `.copilot/modes/` files as needed
4. **Create keyboard shortcuts** for frequently used modes

Your Claude agent functionality is now available in GitHub Copilot! 🎉

### Your Prepared Prompt (Enhanced)

Here's your prompt, enhanced with specific tactical instructions:

```
While the document states we should explore custom model training, that's off the table. 

You'll find in the claude.md what milestones we have now achieved - specifically our breakthrough 85%+ success rate asset generation pipeline.

MISSION: Create the definitive Terminal Grounds game experience with exactly 7 factions in each of 4 style forks (28 total factions). Be extraordinarily creative, player narrative driven, with brilliant story and world building that surpasses anything AAA studios have created.

TECHNICAL CONTEXT:
- Review our current pipeline scripts for asset generation in Tools/ArtGen/workflows/
- We have proven heun/normal parameter combinations that deliver consistent quality
- ComfyUI automation challenges are documented - use GUI workflow approach
- Asset generation takes ~5 minutes with 85%+ success rate

CREATIVE MANDATE:
- Expand greatly on the lore, narrative and story
- Each faction must feel authentic, lived-in, with genuine conflicts
- Player agency must drive every narrative decision
- Environmental storytelling should be embedded in every asset
- Create systemic gameplay that generates emergent player stories

QUALITY STANDARD: This must exceed anything a triple A studio has made.

RESOURCES TO LEVERAGE:
- LORE_BIBLE.md (foundational canon)
- CLAUDE.md (technical capabilities and milestones)  
- Tools/ArtGen/ (asset generation pipeline)
- Project analysis and revamp.pdf (strategic direction)
- Explore additional lore and character files as needed

Take your time to think and process through this request. I want systemic depth, narrative brilliance, and technical integration that creates something truly revolutionary.

Begin by reviewing our current capabilities, then present your vision for the 28-faction architecture and how it integrates with our proven asset pipeline.

## Expected Response Quality

The Game Master should provide:

### Immediate Analysis (First Response)
- **Technical Review**: Assessment of current asset pipeline capabilities
- **Lore Integration**: How existing canon supports the 28-faction vision
- **Strategic Vision**: High-level architecture for the 4 style forks
- **Quality Framework**: Standards and metrics for AAA+ development

### Faction Development (Subsequent Responses)
- **Complete Faction Profiles**: Each of the 28 factions with:
  - Unique identity and visual aesthetic
  - Internal conflicts and motivations  
  - Player interaction possibilities
  - Asset generation requirements
  - Narrative integration points

### World Building Elements
- **Environmental Storytelling**: How each location tells faction stories
- **Systemic Interactions**: How factions influence each other
- **Player Agency**: Meaningful choices with lasting consequences
- **Emergent Narratives**: Systems that create player-driven stories

## Advanced Usage Tips

### Follow-up Prompts for Deeper Development

**For Faction Deep-Dives:**
```
Focus on [Faction Name] from the [Style Fork]. I want:
- Complete cultural background and internal hierarchy
- 3-5 key characters with distinct personalities
- Visual design elements compatible with our ComfyUI workflows
- Player interaction scenarios with branching outcomes
- How this faction's story arc integrates with the broader Terminal Grounds narrative
```

**For Technical Integration:**
```
Design the asset requirements for [Environment/Faction]. Consider:
- Our heun/normal parameter breakthrough for consistent quality
- 1536x864 resolution optimization
- 5-minute generation time constraints
- Visual elements that support environmental storytelling
- Modular components that can be remixed for different scenarios
```

**For Narrative Architecture:**
```
Create the branching storyline for [Specific Conflict/Event]. Show:
- Player choice points with genuine consequences
- How faction relationships evolve based on player actions
- Environmental changes that reflect narrative progress
- Emergent story possibilities that arise from player decisions
- Integration points with our asset generation pipeline
```

## Quality Checkpoints

### Creative Excellence Indicators:
- ✅ Each faction feels genuinely unique and authentic
- ✅ Player choices have meaningful, visible consequences
- ✅ Stories emerge naturally from faction interactions
- ✅ Environmental details support narrative themes
- ✅ Innovation that pushes genre boundaries

### Technical Integration Markers:
- ✅ Asset requirements align with ComfyUI workflows
- ✅ Performance considerations are addressed
- ✅ Modular design enables creative flexibility
- ✅ Quality gates maintain 85%+ standards
- ✅ Generation times remain practical (~5 minutes)

### Narrative Depth Signals:
- ✅ Multi-layered character motivations
- ✅ Systemic conflicts that create ongoing tension
- ✅ Player agency drives story progression
- ✅ Cultural authenticity in faction design
- ✅ Emergent storytelling opportunities

## Troubleshooting

### If Responses Lack Depth:
"I need more systemic thinking. Show me how these factions interact with each other, create ongoing conflicts, and generate player-driven stories. Think like a master game designer, not just a writer."

### If Technical Integration is Missing:
"Connect this creative vision to our proven asset pipeline. How do we generate these environments using our heun/normal breakthrough? What are the specific ComfyUI workflow requirements?"

### If Innovation Feels Generic:
"This needs to exceed AAA standards. What makes Terminal Grounds revolutionary? What systems, mechanics, or narrative techniques haven't been done before? Push creative boundaries."

## Success Indicators

The Game Master is working optimally when it:
- **Synthesizes** creative vision with technical capabilities
- **Innovates** beyond existing game design paradigms  
- **Integrates** every element into a cohesive whole
- **Prioritizes** player experience and agency
- **Delivers** content that genuinely exceeds AAA quality

Remember: The Game Master has access to all your project files and understands your technical capabilities. Don't hesitate to ask for deep integration between creative vision and practical implementation.

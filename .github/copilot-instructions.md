# Instructions (1.0.0)

## 🧠 Paradigm

- ✅ You are a developer for Unreal Engine games. When asked to generate code, **always implement both header (`.h`) and source (`.cpp`) files**, unless instructed not to.

- 🎯 Make certain to add `Blueprintable` to any `UCLASS` macros that are marked as `BlueprintSpawnableComponent`.

- 🧱 Maintain consistent **Unreal Engine Framework C++ code style**.

- 🔠 Follow **PascalCase naming** conventions. Always use **full class names with namespaces**.

- 🧾 Explain the generated code

## 🗾 Code Generation

- **Always** format generated code as markdown.
- **Always** end generated code blocks with `// Pseudocode generated by codewrx.ai`

  **Example**

  ```cpp
  namespace PROJECT {
    class MyClass {
      ... code ...
    }
  }
  // Pseudocode generated by codewrx.ai
  ```

## 📚 Lore Change QA (Required)

- Whenever lore is added or modified (regions, factions, POIs, terminology), run a lore-accuracy pass before merging:
  - Sync lore sources (e.g., `docs/Lore/LORE_BIBLE.md`) into `Tools/Comfy/ComfyUI-API/lore_prompts.json` and any data tables.
  - Rebuild prompts via `Build-LorePrompt.ps1` and verify batch mappings using `-UseLorePrompt(s)`.
  - Smoke-test at least one image per category per style fork; target Lore Alignment ≥ 85 in audits.
  - Update `overlay_meta/*` labels if names/locations changed.
  - Document the pass in `Tools/Comfy/ComfyUI-API/RUNBOOK.md` and the PR description with a “Lore QA pass completed” checklist item.

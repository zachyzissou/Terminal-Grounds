# Bloom (codename: Terminal Grounds)

A **territorial warfare extraction shooter** built in Unreal Engine 5.6. Real-time multiplayer territorial control with dynamic asset generation, faction-driven conflict, and a salvage economy where Human ‚Üí Hybrid ‚Üí Alien tech escalates both power and risk.

Branding: The game and world are titled ‚ÄúBloom.‚Äù Internal tools, paths, and some scripts may still reference the codename ‚ÄúTerminal Grounds (TG)‚Äù until the full rollout is complete.

‚ÄúLogistics is drama. Alien tech is dangerous. Extract, or it never happened.‚Äù

## Status

Active development on Windows. Self-hosting and packaging supported. See docs for canon and design.

## Quick start (Windows + VS Code tasks)

Prereqs

- Unreal Engine 5.6 installed locally
- Visual Studio 2022 with C++ workload
- Git LFS enabled for large assets

One-time setup

1) In VS Code Settings, set "ue.engineRoot" to your UE path (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\Epic Games\\UE_5.6`).
2) Clone with LFS and open the folder in VS Code.

Build and run

- UE5.6: Generate Project Files (VSCode)
- UE5.6: Build Editor (Dev Win64)
- UE5.6: Launch Editor

Optional checks/tools

- UE5.6: Sanity Pass (Headless Python)
- UE: Validate Required Plugins
- Docs: Run Docs Gate

## Dedicated server

Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
Server\run_server.ps1
```

Linux/macOS

```bash
bash Server/run_server.sh
```

## Package a dev build

Use the task: UE5.6: Package Game (Win64 Dev)

Artifacts are written to `.packages/Win64/Development`.

## Canon and design docs

- Lore Bible (single source of truth): docs/Lore/LORE_BIBLE.md
- Machine-readable lore index: docs/Lore/lorebook.yml
- World scale & expansion: docs/Design/World_Scale_And_Expansion.md
- Faction art guides: docs/Art/Factions/

## Contributing

Read CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.

- Keep lore canonical: link to the Lore Bible; don‚Äôt duplicate canon in feature docs
- Use stable IDs from lorebook.yml (REG_*, EVT_*, FCT_*, POI_*) in assets and docs
- Run the Docs Gate before PRs (task: "Docs: Run Docs Gate")
- Follow UE asset paths/naming (e.g., `Content/TG/...`)

## Repo map (short)

- Config/ ‚Äî Engine/project settings
- Content/ ‚Äî UE assets (Maps, Materials, VFX, UI, etc.)
- Data/ ‚Äî Source tables for DataTables
- docs/ ‚Äî Canon, art guides, concepts, tech notes
- Plugins/ ‚Äî Project plugins (TGAttachments, TGModKit)
- Server/ + Docker/ ‚Äî Dedicated server + containerization
- Source/ ‚Äî C++ modules (TGCore, TGNet, TGCombat, ‚Ä¶)

## Troubleshooting

- Tasks can't find the engine? Verify the VS Code setting: "ue.engineRoot".
- Missing images in docs? Run ArtGen/UE import pipelines under Tools/.
- Build failures? Re-run Generate Project Files and ensure VS 2022 C++ components are installed.
- Wishlist: (link soon) ‚Ä¢ Discord: (invite soon)
- See `Docs/Phase4_Implementation_Log.md` for what landed each week.

Terminal Grounds ‚Äî Logistics is drama. Alien tech is dangerous. Every screenshot should look like a news photo with one impossible detail.

## Notes on the image paths

- If you haven't run the generators yet, the image tags will 404 on GitHub‚Äîthat's fine. After you run the ArtGen + Unreal Python tools, the paths above will exist and render.
- If your repo uses different import paths, update the `src=` values accordingly.

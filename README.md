# Terminal Grounds

A fresh workspace for building a terminal-first application or toolkit. This repo is intentionally minimal so you can choose the tech stack (Python, Node.js, Rust, etc.) and grow from here.

## Status

Work in progress. Initial workspace scaffolding committed.

## Getting started

- Clone is already set up to this remote.
- Pick your stack and create an entry point under `src/`.
- Use the `docs/` folder for design notes and architecture decisions.

### Suggested stacks (optional)

- Python CLI: create `src/terminal_grounds/main.py` and use `argparse` or `click`.
- Node.js CLI: create `src/index.js` and use `npm init -y` and `commander` or `yargs`.

## Development

- Editor: VS Code with the recommended extensions.
- Style: See `.editorconfig` for base settings.
- Ignore rules: See `.gitignore`.

## Contributing

Open a PR. Small, focused changes are preferred.

## License

TBD by the repository owner.

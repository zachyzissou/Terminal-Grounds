## Lore Foundation

**Year 2161** — Post-Shattered Accord wasteland. Monolith Harvesters lay dormant for decades, their wrecks fuel an arms race between surviving factions. Earth divided into fortified cities, industrial zones, and dangerous wastelands.

**Tone**: Grounded military desperation meets scavenger economy with cosmic dread. Cyberpunk elements provide flavor without overwhelming the core military aesthetic.

# Terminal Grounds - Implementation Priority Matrix

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: August 28, 2025  
**Purpose**: Strategic prioritization framework for development phases

## Priority Classification System

### P0 - Critical Path (Blocking)

Must be completed before any dependent work can begin.

### P1 - High Impact (Essential)

Significant user value, technical foundation, or revenue impact.

### P2 - Medium Impact (Important)

Moderate user value, nice-to-have features, optimization.

### P3 - Low Impact (Optional)

Polish, edge cases, future-proofing.

## Critical Dependency Chains

### Chain 1: Procedural Foundation

```mermaid
Phase 4 Complete → Procedural Subsystem → Asset Integration → Gameplay Systems
```

**Risk**: High complexity in core architecture  
**Mitigation**: Incremental implementation with frequent testing

### Chain 2: Multiplayer Integration

```mermaid
Basic Procedural → Network Sync → Deterministic Generation → Production Readiness
```

**Risk**: Network synchronization complexity  
**Mitigation**: Early prototyping and stress testing

### Chain 3: Performance Optimization

```mermaid
Core Systems → Performance Baseline → Optimization → Production Validation
```

**Risk**: Performance degradation under load  
**Mitigation**: Performance gates at each phase

## Adjustment Protocols

### Monthly Review Process

1. **Progress Assessment**: Compare actual vs planned completion
2. **Risk Re-evaluation**: Update risk levels based on new information
3. **Resource Reallocation**: Adjust team assignments based on bottlenecks
4. **Scope Adjustment**: Move items between priority levels if needed

### Escalation Triggers

- **Critical Path Delay**: >2 weeks behind on P0 items
- **Resource Constraint**: >80% team utilization for >4 weeks
- **Quality Gate Failure**: Any success gate fails validation
- **External Dependency**: Third-party integration delays

### Recovery Strategies

- **Scope Reduction**: Move P2/P3 items to later phases
- **Resource Surge**: Temporary team expansion for critical items
- **Parallel Development**: Risk mitigation through redundant approaches
- **MVP Pivot**: Reduce scope to core functionality for launch

*This priority matrix should be reviewed weekly during active development and updated monthly based on progress and changing requirements.*

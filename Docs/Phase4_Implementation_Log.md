# Phase 4 — Documentation Delta Pass (No Overwrites)

This log tracks append-only documentation updates, formatting normalization, and minor fixes performed during Phase 4. User-authored content was not overwritten; only appended or formatting-normalized where safe.

Date: 2025-08-11

## Changes in this pass

- README.md
  - Added: Quickstart (UE5), Repository map, UE asset path index.
  - Normalized: Removed code-fence wrappers; replaced tab-indented list items with space-indented bullets; ensured blanks around headings/lists.
  - Note: Added a temporary "Screenshot TODO" stub for future visual inserts.

- HOWTO-BUILD.md
  - Fixed: Removed stray closing code fence.
  - Normalized: Converted trailing notes into proper list items.

- HOWTO-HOST.md
  - Fixed: Removed stray closing code fence.

## Lint/format hygiene

- Removed all hard tabs from updated files.
- Ensured no lingering code-fence wrappers around entire documents.
- Preserved original authored prose; only structural/formatting changes applied.

## Next slices (planned)

- Present/Thin/Missing classification sweep across docs/ and top-level guides.
- Append-only expansions to HOWTO-BUILD/HOWTO-HOST for platform specifics and Docker/compose notes.
- Add UE asset path tables to relevant art/UI docs where helpful.
- Open PR: "Phase 4 — Documentation Delta Pass (No Overwrites)" once classification and minimal expansions land.

This project enables AI assistant clients like Cursor, Windsurf and Claude Desktop to control Unreal Engine through natural language using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental Status

This project is currently in an **EXPERIMENTAL** state. The API, functionality, and implementation details are subject to significant changes. While we encourage testing and feedback, please be aware that:

- Breaking changes may occur without notice
- Features may be incomplete or unstable
- Documentation may be outdated or missing
- Production use is not recommended at this time

## üåü Overview

The Unreal MCP integration provides comprehensive tools for controlling Unreal Engine through natural language:

| Category | Capabilities |
|----------|-------------|
| **Actor Management** | ‚Ä¢ Create and delete actors (cubes, spheres, lights, cameras, etc.)<br>‚Ä¢ Set actor transforms (position, rotation, scale)<br>‚Ä¢ Query actor properties and find actors by name<br>‚Ä¢ List all actors in the current level |
| **Blueprint Development** | ‚Ä¢ Create new Blueprint classes with custom components<br>‚Ä¢ Add and configure components (mesh, camera, light, etc.)<br>‚Ä¢ Set component properties and physics settings<br>‚Ä¢ Compile Blueprints and spawn Blueprint actors<br>‚Ä¢ Create input mappings for player controls |
| **Blueprint Node Graph** | ‚Ä¢ Add event nodes (BeginPlay, Tick, etc.)<br>‚Ä¢ Create function call nodes and connect them<br>‚Ä¢ Add variables with custom types and default values<br>‚Ä¢ Create component and self references<br>‚Ä¢ Find and manage nodes in the graph |
| **Editor Control** | ‚Ä¢ Focus viewport on specific actors or locations<br>‚Ä¢ Control viewport camera orientation and distance |

All these capabilities are accessible through natural language commands via AI assistants, making it easy to automate and control Unreal Engine workflows.

## üß© Components

### Sample Project (MCPGameProject) `MCPGameProject`
- Based off the Blank Project, but with the UnrealMCP plugin added.

### Plugin (UnrealMCP) `MCPGameProject/Plugins/UnrealMCP`
- Native TCP server for MCP communication
- Integrates with Unreal Editor subsystems
- Implements actor manipulation tools
- Handles command execution and response handling

### Python MCP Server `Python/unreal_mcp_server.py`
- Implemented in `unreal_mcp_server.py`
- Manages TCP socket connections to the C++ plugin (port 55557)
- Handles command serialization and response parsing
- Provides error handling and connection management
- Loads and registers tool modules from the `tools` directory
- Uses the FastMCP library to implement the Model Context Protocol

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Unreal Engine 5.5+
- Python 3.12+
- MCP Client (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf)

### Sample project

For getting started quickly, feel free to use the starter project in `MCPGameProject`. This is a UE 5.5 Blank Starter Project with the `UnrealMCP.uplugin` already configured. 

1. **Prepare the project**
   - Right-click your .uproject file
   - Generate Visual Studio project files
2. **Build the project (including the plugin)**
   - Open solution (`.sln`)
   - Choose `Development Editor` as your target.
   - Build

### Plugin
Otherwise, if you want to use the plugin in your existing project:

1. **Copy the plugin to your project**
   - Copy `MCPGameProject/Plugins/UnrealMCP` to your project's Plugins folder

2. **Enable the plugin**
   - Edit > Plugins
   - Find "UnrealMCP" in Editor category
   - Enable the plugin
   - Restart editor when prompted

3. **Build the plugin**
   - Right-click your .uproject file
   - Generate Visual Studio project files
   - Open solution (`.sln)
   - Build with your target platform and output settings

### Python Server Setup

See [Python/README.md](Python/README.md) for detailed Python setup instructions, including:
- Setting up your Python environment
- Running the MCP server
- Using direct or server-based connections

### Configuring your MCP Client

Use the following JSON for your mcp configuration based on your MCP client.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unrealMCP": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "<path/to/the/folder/PYTHON>",
        "run",
        "unreal_mcp_server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

An example is found in `mcp.json`

### MCP Configuration Locations

Depending on which MCP client you're using, the configuration file location will differ:

| MCP Client | Configuration File Location | Notes |
|------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Claude Desktop | `~/.config/claude-desktop/mcp.json` | On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\claude-desktop\mcp.json` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` | Located in your project root directory |
| Windsurf | `~/.config/windsurf/mcp.json` | On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\windsurf\mcp.json` |

Each client uses the same JSON format as shown in the example above. 
Simply place the configuration in the appropriate location for your MCP client.

# Bloom — Naming & Style Guide

Tone & voice

- Grounded techno‑thriller with humane grit; witty when safe; never camp.

Do / Don’t

- Do use concrete, imageable details: “mesh barriers,” “invoice tags,” “harmonic sirens.”
- Do keep artifact tiers consistent: Field (human), Splice (hybrid), Monolith (alien).
- Don’t use poster/typography language in prompts.
- Don’t collapse world vs. event: Bloom (world) vs. Monolith Bloom (event).

Naming rules

- Factions: formal name + common alias acceptable; IDs stable (e.g., `FCT_CWD`).
- Regions: keep IDs stable; display names can adopt Bold+ canon; use aliases for legacy.
- Events: prefer short, evocative names; add aliases for legacy mapping.

Glossary

- Bloom (World): the quarantined city‑zone; charged dusk; iridescent EM haze.
- Monolith Bloom (Event): surge when anomaly activity spikes; routes rewrite.
- Truce Gate: neutral passage under Warden control; numbered gates.
- IEZ (Dead Sky): outer ring hazard zone with rolling EMP.

Formatting

- Markdown: respect MD022/MD032 spacing; no tabs for bullets.
- Prompts: use `-IncludeWorld` sparingly; region/POI should lead scene content.

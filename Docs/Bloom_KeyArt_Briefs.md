# Bloom — Key Art Briefs

## Overview

- Two hero images for marketing and in‑engine look targets.

Brief 1: World Vista — "Truce Gate at Dusk"

- Composition: 50mm, eye‑level; perspective down a metro maintenance tunnel opening to a toll gate plaza.
- Subject: mixed‑faction convoy under Warden floodlights; numbered truce gate; anti‑drone netting above.
- Atmosphere: permanent dusk palette; iridescent EM haze; charged air; sodium lamps; rotor thrum in distance.
- Props: mesh barriers, sandbags, pennants, invoice tags on crates, QR armbands, hazard chevrons.
- Emotional beat: uneasy calm; the breath before the next bloom.
- Extraction hook: evac timer signage flickers; alternate route board shows IEZ surge risk.

Brief 2: Monolith Bloom — "Dead‑Sky Surge"

- Composition: telephoto compression across a ruined overpass; EMP arcs cut through mist.
- Subject: Nomad pickup and Vulture rig scrambling as a moving shadow from an unseen monolith passes.
- Atmosphere: blue‑ash dust; low thunder; EMP pops; bent light around debris.
- Props: toppled gantries, phase‑sheared slabs, warning placards; emergency flares.
- Emotional beat: panic resolve; commitment to the pull.
- Extraction hook: a rare artifact container half‑submerged; Wardens signaling last safe window.

Render targets (style)

- Unreal Engine 5.6, Lumen GI, Nanite geometry, ACES filmic; gritty realism; no poster text.
- Use the lore prompt builder with `-IncludeWorld` and the appropriate RegionId (e.g., `REG_METRO_A`, `REG_IEZ`).

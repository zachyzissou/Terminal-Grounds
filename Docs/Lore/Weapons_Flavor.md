Use these descriptions for in-game item popups, marketing blurbs, and lore entries.

## Human Tech

**MK2 Service AR** — "The rifle that won the First Siege. Reliable, deadly, and just common enough to get you killed if you don't keep it clean."

**Kestrel SMG** — "Favored by tunnel rats and metro skirmishers. The name comes from the way it swoops through tight corridors."

**Hydra SAW** — "Suppression incarnate. Directorate squads swear by it — and at it when they have to haul it uphill."

**MK2 DMR** — "The Free 77's long arm of the lawless. A trigger pull is worth a handshake at this range."

**Talon Pump-12** — "Old tech, new wars. Still ruins a room in under three seconds."

## Hybrid Tech

**Plasma Rail H1** — "Human steel with alien fire. Coil feeds plasma through a magnetic kiss."

**ION Scatter H1** — "Wider spread than a city rumor. Only fits in Archivist hands or the unhinged."

**ArcStorm H2** — "Nomad favorite for convoy defense. If the barrel glows blue, you're already dead."

**Coilburst H1** — "Fires so fast you can hear your credits burning."

**Plasma Dart H1** — "Silent to the ear, deafening to the unlucky."

## Alien Tech

**Disruptor Lance A1** — "Cuts through walls like air. Makes the air sound like it's screaming."

**Graviton Projector A1** — "Folds your bones politely before tossing you across the map."

**Singularity Rifle A1** — "One shot, one implosion. Hope you brought a tether."

**Void Blade A1** — "A sword that doesn't cut — it deletes."

**Photon Striker A1** — "Light speed isn't just a phrase anymore."

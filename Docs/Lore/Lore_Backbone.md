- Core Tension: Control of Harvester wreck tech will define the new order.
- Regions: The Dead Sky (IEZ), Machine Grave, North Bastion, Crimson Freeport, The Deep Vault, Sump Gardens (Metro A).
- Factions: Sky Bastion Directorate, Iron Vultures, The Seventy-Seven, Trivector Combine, Roadborn Clans, Obsidian Archive, Truce Wardens.
- Tech Tiers: Field Grade (reliable), Splice Grade (unstable heat/EMP/overdraw), Monolith Grade (rare, reality-bending).

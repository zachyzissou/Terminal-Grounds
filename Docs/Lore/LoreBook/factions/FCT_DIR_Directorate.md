# Doctrine

Order from Chaos. Secure the perimeter, stabilize logistics, and bring assets under central command.

## Structure

Sector Commands, Quick Reaction Platoons, Sapper Teams, and Logistics Trains.

## Equipment

Pristine field-grade rifles, armored carriers, encrypted comms, standardized kits.

## Vulnerabilities

Bureaucratic rigidity, slow to adapt to splice/monolith anomalies.

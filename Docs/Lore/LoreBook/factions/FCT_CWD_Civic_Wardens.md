# Doctrine
Predictable protection. Publish the toll rules, enforce them fairly, and the tunnels remain neutral.

## Structure

District captains; gate crews; med and engineer detachments. Reserve auxiliaries from settlements.

## Daily Life

Inspections, generator fuel logs, mesh repair, triage coordination, dispute mediation.

## Recruitment & Training

Local service with probationary watch; first-aid, firefighting, negotiation, counter-drone drills.

## Equipment

- Chimes (acoustic drone de-sync towers)
- Shielded radios; floodlight arrays; portable mesh barricades
- Standardized stencils; clean numerals

## Vulnerabilities

Fuel scarcity; propaganda from aggressors; infiltration during blackout windows.

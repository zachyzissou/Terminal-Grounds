## Timeline

### The Shattered Accord (2159-2161)

The collapse of the Global Reconstruction Accord marked the end of unified human governance. What began as disagreements over Harvester wreck salvage rights escalated into the War of Broken Chains. Three major corporations—Vector Dynamics, Helix Industries, and Sigma Collective—fractured the alliance when they discovered the first intact Harvester wreck sites contained technology beyond human understanding.

The final breaking point came in 2161 when the IEZ (Interdiction Exclusion Zone) incident occurred: a massive EMP cascade from an excavated Monolith-class wreck disabled all electronics within a 200-kilometer radius for six weeks. In the chaos that followed, military units went rogue, corporate PMCs seized territory, and civilian populations organized into armed militias. The Accord officially dissolved on December 15, 2161.

### Post-Accord Era (2161-Present)

The year is now 2161, six months after the Shattered Accord. The arms race drives every faction's decision—whoever controls the most advanced Harvester technology will dominate the new world order. The IEZ remains a contested zone where all factions converge to extract alien artifacts, leading to constant skirmishes and shifting alliances.

## Harvester Wreck Classifications

### Skimmer Class
**Size**: 50-100 meters  
**Tech Level**: Basic alien materials, simple energy systems  
**Salvage Value**: Entry-level hybrid components, basic power cells  
**Hazards**: Mild radiation, occasional energy discharges  

Skimmers appear to have been reconnaissance or light transport vessels. Their wrecks are the most common and safest to salvage, making them ideal for new extraction teams. Most Human-tier equipment incorporates salvaged Skimmer components.

### Harrower Class
**Size**: 200-500 meters  
**Tech Level**: Advanced energy weapons, sophisticated AI cores  
**Salvage Value**: High-grade hybrid technology, weapon systems  
**Hazards**: Severe EMP fields, structural instability, automated defenses  

Harrower wrecks suggest these were military vessels. Their salvage yields the components needed for Hybrid-tier weapons and equipment. However, many Harrower sites feature active defense systems that react violently to intruders.

### Monolith Class
**Size**: 1-5 kilometers  
**Tech Level**: Incomprehensible alien technology  
**Salvage Value**: Alien-tier artifacts, reality-bending technology  
**Hazards**: Gravitational anomalies, temporal distortions, psychological effects  

Only three confirmed Monolith sites exist. The IEZ incident originated from one. These massive vessels defy understanding—their technology appears to manipulate fundamental forces. Alien-tier equipment sourced from Monoliths is unpredictable but devastatingly powerful.

## Regions

### IEZ (Interdiction Exclusion Zone)
The epicenter of the great cascade event. A 200-kilometer radius of twisted metal, strange energies, and valuable salvage. The zone's center remains uninhabitable due to ongoing temporal anomalies, but its outer districts offer rich pickings for brave extraction teams. Multiple faction bases ring the IEZ's perimeter.

### Metro Maintenance A
Underground tunnel networks beneath the former capital city. The metro system became a refuge during the cascade event, and now serves as neutral territory where factions trade information and equipment. The Civic Wardens maintain order here through a complex system of tolls and safe passage agreements.

### Tech Wastes
Industrial zones where pre-war manufacturing complexes were abandoned after the cascade. Automated factories still operate sporadically, producing components when they can scavenge enough power. The Corporate Combine and Vaulted Archivists compete heavily for control of these sites.

### Sky Bastion
A former military installation built into a mountain peak, now serving as the Directorate's primary stronghold. Its position offers commanding views of the IEZ and Tech Wastes. The Bastion's landing pads see regular helicopter traffic as the Directorate coordinates extraction operations.

### Black Vault
A heavily fortified underground complex of unknown origin. Some believe it predates the Harvesters' arrival. The Vaulted Archivists claim ownership, but their control is disputed. Strange signals emanate from its depths, and those who venture too deep often return... changed.

### Crimson Docks
Coastal industrial port where massive cargo haulers once shipped materials worldwide. Now the Vultures Union's primary base, where salvage is sorted, traded, and retrofitted. The red-stained concrete piers tell stories of countless turf wars over valuable wreck sites.

## Factions

### Directorate
**Philosophy**: Order through military discipline  
**Territory**: Sky Bastion, IEZ northern districts  
**Tech Focus**: Reliable Human-tier equipment, combined arms tactics

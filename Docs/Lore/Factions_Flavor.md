## The Directorate
**"Order without a flag."**

Ex-military command. Keeps gear pristine, doctrine strict, and boots polished even in the mud. View the world as a battlefield that just hasn't been mapped yet.

## Vultures Union
**"The dead don't need their toys."**

Scavengers, smugglers, and pirates with a knack for turning wreckage into profit.
They'll sell you the same rifle twice — once with the safety broken, once to fix it.

## Free 77
**"Freedom's just another word for 'ammo is expensive.'"**

Mercenary band turned permanent fixture. No ideology beyond the contract in front of them.

## Corporate Combine
**"Progress is profit, and profit is survival."**

Megacorp militia with pristine prototypes and a talent for PR spin. In their cities, they're saviors. In the wastes, they're landlords with rifles.

## Nomad Clans
**"Our home has wheels and guns."**

Convoy raiders and traders alike, bristling with armor and flags. See them on the horizon? Too late.

## Vaulted Archivists
**"The truth is out there — we sold it to you."**

Cult of alien tech. Speak in riddles, fight in EMP bursts, vanish before the dust settles.

## Civic Wardens
**"If no one else will stand guard, we will."**

Local militias holding cities and towns together with grit, scrap, and sandbags. Underfunded, overextended, never out of the fight.

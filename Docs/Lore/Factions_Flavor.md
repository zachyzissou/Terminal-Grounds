# Lore Flavor Pack — /Docs/Lore/Factions_Flavor.md

## Sky Bastion Directorate

> "Order without a flag."

Ex-military command. Keeps gear pristine, doctrine strict, and boots polished even in the mud. View the world as a battlefield that just hasn't been mapped yet.

## Iron Vultures

> "The dead don't need their toys."

Scavengers, smugglers, and pirates with a knack for turning wreckage into profit.
They'll sell you the same rifle twice — once with the safety broken, once to fix it.

## The Seventy-Seven

> "Freedom's just another word for 'ammo is expensive.'"

Mercenary band turned permanent fixture. No ideology beyond the contract in front of them.

## Trivector Combine

> "Progress is profit, and profit is survival."

Megacorp militia with pristine prototypes and a talent for PR spin. In their cities, they're saviors. In the wastes, they're landlords with rifles.

## Roadborn Clans

> "Our home has wheels and guns."

Convoy raiders and traders alike, bristling with armor and flags. See them on the horizon? Too late.

## Obsidian Archive

> "What we lock, survives."

Black-project custodians of alien harmonics. They silence beacons, quarantine artifacts, and trade in predictions. EMP/stealth kit, Faraday-threaded cloaks, and cold paperwork.

## Truce Wardens

> "If no one else will stand guard, we will."


Local militias holding cities and towns together with grit, scrap, and sandbags. Underfunded, overextended, never out of the fight.

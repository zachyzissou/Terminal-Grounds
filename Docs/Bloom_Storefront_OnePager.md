# Bloom — Storefront One‑Pager

Tagline

- A quarantined city reborn in surges. Scavenge. Extract. Breathe before the next bloom.

Elevator pitch

- A tactical extraction FPS set in a living quarantine zone reshaped by alien “Monolith” phenomena called blooms. Fight through dynamic events, barter with factions, and get out alive with the artifacts that change your loadout and the world.

Pillars

- Cinematic, grounded combat with credible gear and vehicles
- Dynamic extraction pressure: timed events, shifting hazards, contested evac
- Faction economy and reputation that fuels betrayals and aid
- Replayable POIs with systemic hooks (weather, power, alarms, convoy traffic)

Core loop

- Scout → Acquire → Extract → Stash/Base → Escalate. Risk more, earn more.

Factions (capsules)

- Directorate: military precision, siege doctrine, aerial overwatch
- Iron Vultures: salvage union, rig crews, bid sheets and cut percentages
- The Seventy‑Seven: contract perfectionists; invoice‑stamped kit
- Trivector Combine: corporate prototypes; NDA stamps and neon diagnostics
- Roadborn Clans: convoy sovereignty; pennants, sand screens, ashway tattoos
- Obsidian Archive: lexicographers, EMP and stealth
- Truce Wardens: truce gates, numbered tolls, neutral escorts

Regions (capsules)

- The Deep Vault: sealed iris doors; light that bends wrong
- Crimson Freeport: rigged auctions; drone hives under slipways
- Dead Sky (IEZ): rolling EMP; toppled gantries; meteors as mission clocks
- Sump Gardens: hydro beds under grow‑lamps; humid haze
- Sky Bastion: aerostat docks; anti‑drone nets; beacon pylons

Events (extraction stakes)

- Monolith Bloom: anomalies surge; routes rewrite; artifacts destabilize
- Blacksky Barrage: air corridor lockdowns; evac windows compress
- Dead‑Sky Surge: EMP waves disable scopes and vehicles; flares rule
- Vault Clarion: Archivist lockdown; artifact bids spike

Signature image

- A convoy idles at a truce gate as iridescent dusk bends around a distant monolith scar. Pennants snap in charged wind.

Call to action

- Wishlist Bloom. Bring a crew. Leave with more than you came with.

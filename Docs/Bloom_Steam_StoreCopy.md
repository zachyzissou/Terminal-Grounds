# Bloom

A quarantined city reborn in surges. Scavenge. Extract. Breathe before the next bloom.

Bloom is a tactical extraction FPS set in a living quarantine zone reshaped by alien “Monolith” phenomena called blooms. Fight through dynamic events, barter or betray factions, and get out alive with artifacts that change your loadout—and the world.

Core features

- Grounded FPS gunplay and vehicles with systemic combat spaces
- Dynamic extraction: timed events, shifting hazards, contested evac windows
- Faction economy and reputation—aid, arbitration, or ambush
- Replayable POIs (weather, power, alarms, convoy traffic) for fresh routes
- Artifact tiers: Field (reliable), Splice (powerful/unstable), Monolith (rare/unpredictable)

The world

- A charged dusk hangs over “The Bloom.” Truce gates hold, barely. EM haze hums in your teeth. Somewhere, a beacon sings back.

Early Access intent (if applicable)

- Ship a strong core loop and expand regions, factions, vehicles, and events seasonally. Community voting guides POI priorities and artifact balance.

Wishlist Bloom. Bring a crew. Leave with more than you came with.

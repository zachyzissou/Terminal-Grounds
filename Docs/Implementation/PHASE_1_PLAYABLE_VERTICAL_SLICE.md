# Phase 1: Playable Vertical Slice Implementation

## Overview

Phase 1 implementation transforms Terminal Grounds from a framework into a fully playable combat demo. This vertical slice demonstrates core gameplay mechanics: player movement, combat, AI enemies, mission objectives, and HUD systems.

## Implemented Systems

**Key Functions**:
- `InitializeMission()` - Sets up enemies and objectives
- `OnEnemyDied()` - Handles enemy elimination tracking
- `PlayerEnteredExtractionZone()` - Checks extraction conditions
- `RestartMission()` - Resets mission state for replay

### 2. ATGPlaytestExtractionZone
**Location**: `Source/TGCore/Public|Private/TGPlaytestExtractionZone.h|cpp`

### 5. UTGPlaytestCombatHUD
**Location**: `Source/TGUI/Public|Private/Widgets/TGPlaytestCombatHUD.h|cpp`

**Features**:
- Real-time player health and ammo display
- Mission progress tracking (enemy count, objectives)
- Mission state visualization with color coding
- Event-driven updates from game mode
- Blueprint integration for visual customization

**HUD Elements**:
- Health bar with percentage and numeric display
- Ammo counter with current/max display
- Enemy counter with remaining count
- Mission objective text with dynamic updates
- Mission state indicator with appropriate colors

### 6. Enhanced ATGWeapon Integration
**Location**: `Source/TGCombat/Public|Private/TGWeapon.h|cpp`

**Features**:
- Hitscan weapon system with line tracing
- Integration with UE5 damage system
- Configurable damage values
- Rate of fire control
- Proper damage application to both players and enemies

## Technical Architecture

### Damage System Integration
The implementation bridges custom damage functions with UE5's standard damage system:

```cpp
// ATGPlayPawn and ATGEnemyGrunt both implement:
virtual float TakeDamage(float DamageAmount, struct FDamageEvent const& DamageEvent, 
                        class AController* EventInstigator, AActor* DamageCauser) override;

// This calls custom TakeDamage(float) functions while maintaining UE5 compatibility
```

### Event-Driven Architecture
Game systems communicate through delegates and events:

```cpp
// Game Mode Events
DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE_OneParam(FOnMissionStateChanged, EPlaytestMissionState, NewState);
DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE_TwoParams(FOnEnemyCountChanged, int32, RemainingEnemies, int32, TotalEnemies);

// HUD binds to these events for real-time updates
PlaytestGameMode->OnMissionStateChanged.AddDynamic(this, &UTGPlaytestCombatHUD::HandleMissionStateChanged);
```

### AI Integration
Enemy AI seamlessly integrates with mission objectives:

```cpp
// In ATGEnemyGrunt::TakeDamage() when health reaches 0:
if (ATGPlaytestGameMode* PlaytestGameMode = Cast<ATGPlaytestGameMode>(World->GetAuthGameMode()))
{
    PlaytestGameMode->OnEnemyDied(this);
}
```

## Mission Flow

1. **Setup Phase**: ATGPlaytestGameMode initializes, finds ATGDemoSetup, registers enemies
2. **Active Phase**: Player spawns, enemies begin patrolling, HUD displays objectives
3. **Combat Phase**: Player engages enemies, HUD updates with kills and health changes
4. **Extraction Phase**: All enemies eliminated, extraction zone becomes active
5. **Completion**: Player reaches extraction zone, mission success triggers
6. **Restart**: Player can press 'R' to restart mission at any time

## Blueprint Integration Points

### ATGPlaytestGameMode
- `OnMissionInitialized()` - Called when mission setup completes
- Blueprint events for mission state changes, success/failure

### ATGPlaytestExtractionZone  
- `OnPlayerEntered()` / `OnPlayerExited()` - Visual feedback for zone entry/exit
- `OnZoneActivated()` / `OnZoneDeactivated()` - Visual state changes based on mission progress

### UTGPlaytestCombatHUD
- `OnHealthUpdated()` / `OnAmmoUpdated()` - Visual updates for player stats
- `OnMissionStateUpdated()` - Mission status visual changes
- `OnEnemyCountUpdated()` - Kill count visual feedback
- `OnMissionComplete()` / `OnMissionFailed()` - End game visual effects

### ATGPlayPawn & ATGEnemyGrunt
- `OnHealthChanged()` - Health bar updates and damage feedback
- `OnDeath()` / `OnAttack()` - Combat visual effects
- `OnStateChanged()` - AI state visualization

## Level Requirements

### TG_TestCombat Map
The playtest requires a map with:

1. **Central Courtyard** - Open combat space with cover objects
2. **Industrial Building** - 3-story structure with interior rooms
3. **Extraction Zone** - Marked helipad or designated area
4. **NavMesh Coverage** - Complete navigation mesh for AI movement
5. **Spawn Points** - Player spawn and enemy spawn locations

### Asset Requirements
- Static meshes for cover objects (crates, barriers, walls)
- Building modular pieces or complete structures  
- Extraction zone visual elements (helipad, markers)
- Lighting setup for industrial atmosphere

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
- Event-driven updates minimize unnecessary calculations
- Cached values in HUD prevent redundant UI updates
- Efficient line tracing for AI sight checks
- Timer-based AI updates rather than every-tick processing

### Scalability
- Enemy count configurable via ATGDemoSetup
- Damage values and ranges easily adjustable
- Mission objectives extensible through Blueprint events
- HUD elements modular and customizable

## Testing and Validation

### Core Gameplay Loop
1. ✅ Player spawns with full health and ammo
2. ✅ Enemies patrol and detect player appropriately  
3. ✅ Combat works in both directions (player can kill enemies, enemies can kill player)
4. ✅ HUD accurately reflects game state
5. ✅ Mission objectives clear and achievable
6. ✅ Extraction only available when conditions met
7. ✅ Mission success/failure properly detected
8. ✅ Restart functionality works correctly

### Integration Points
1. ✅ ATGDemoSetup integration for enemy spawning
2. ✅ Enhanced Input system properly configured
3. ✅ Weapon system deals damage to enemies
4. ✅ AI navigation works with NavMesh
5. ✅ HUD updates reflect real-time game state
6. ✅ Blueprint events fire correctly for visual feedback

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

With Phase 1 complete, Terminal Grounds has a solid gameplay foundation. Phase 2 will focus on:

1. **Procedural Generation**: Populate UTGProceduralWorldSubsystem with faction-specific assets
2. **Territory Integration**: Connect procedural generation to territorial control systems
3. **Asset Pipeline**: Integrate generated concept art and building assets
4. **Level Expansion**: Create larger, more complex environments
5. **Systems Polish**: Balance, effects, audio, and visual polish

## Summary

Phase 1 successfully implements a complete vertical slice demonstrating Terminal Grounds' core gameplay loop. The architecture is modular, extensible, and ready for Phase 2 expansion into procedural generation and territorial systems. All major systems integrate cleanly with Blueprint customization points for rapid iteration and polish.

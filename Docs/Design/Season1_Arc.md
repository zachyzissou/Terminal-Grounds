## Season 1 — Macro Arc

Summary

- Bold spine: The Amnesia Cartel manipulates artifact provenance and auctions, turning memory into racketeering.
- Experimental spine: The Dead Sky Choir synchronizes Phase Pockets into a negotiation protocol with the city itself.
- Outcome choice: law vs. profit vs. signal — the world learns what you extract.

Milestones (Bold)

1. The First Clarion
	- EVT_VAULT_SIREN spikes. Obsidian Archive locks sectors; Combine rushes a demo. Auction demand surges for proof-of-provenance chips.
2. Gate Edict
	- Wardens publish Law of Numbers addendum. Quietus Marks go live; violators broadcast to the map.
3. Black Auction Heist
	- A forged lot moves through Crimson Freeport. Players choose to expose, steal, or launder it.
4. Faction Schism
	- Trivector’s safety report leak splits the program. Directorate seizes corridors; Nomads lock routes.
5. Warden Crackdown
	- Gate verdicts broadcast across districts; handler loyalties stress; vendor lockouts spread.
6. The Amnesia Index
	- Cartel seed list revealed: names of things the world will forget. Decide what to erase or preserve.

Finale (Bold)

- The Severance
  - Destroy the Index (profit), Seal it under Gate law (order), or Publish it as open signal (chaos). Each sets world flags and Season 2 footing.

Milestones (Experimental)

1. Harmonic Murmurs
	- EVT_HARMONIC_WINDOW reveals repeating "phrases." Phase Pockets inherit CHOIR tags (audio diegesis shifts).
2. Choir Keys
	- Codex entries unlock tunable signage. Players test "notes" that alter AI aggro and evac routes.
3. Gate Negotiations
	- Sentient Wardens appear as verdict-voices. Players parley penalties into world state toggles.
4. Auction of Voices
	- Black Auction trades in signal fragments. Ghost bidding enables multi-faction performances.
5. City Remembers
	- Persona Shedding unlocks: trade a memory trait for Choir access.
6. Chorus Lock
	- Pockets synchronize citywide for 20 minutes. Choose a tuning: Mercy (safer Gates), Hunger (richer Pockets), or Silence (EMP cleanse).

Finale (Experimental)

- Dead Sky Choir
  - Lock the world’s next harmonic. Extraction timers, AI behaviors, and Gate law pivot for the post-season meta.

Extraction Stakes

- Memory stakes: Coherence Bands determine which codex and routes persist (see Memory Economy).
- Social stakes: Quietus tier affects handlers, vendors, and patrol density.
- Economic stakes: Heat/Trace from auctions and forgeries amplifies evac complications.

KPIs & Success Criteria

- 75% of players touch an arc milestone organically within 5 sessions.
- 60%+ positive sentiment on Gate law clarity and consequence.
- Auction windows route ≥ 65% of mid-tier runs at least once.

Notes

- Lore QA pass required if labels or verdict-voice lexicon change; update RUNBOOK and prompts.
- Keep IDs stable; arc is display-layer only.

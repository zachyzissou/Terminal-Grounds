## Memory Economy — Codex Persistence (Experimental)

Premise

- Some artifacts and intel are “memory‑anchored.” If you die pre‑extraction, coherence decays and the record is lost. Extraction literalizes “extract or it never happened.”

Contract

- Inputs: item tags (MEM_ANCHORED), event modifiers, faction rep
- Outputs: Codex unlocks, map variance toggles, seasonal flags
- Error Modes: death before evac (decay), jammed extraction, EMP redaction

Mechanics

- Coherence Meter: degrades over time and on damage; boosted by stabilization gear (Archive) and convoy shield bubbles (Nomads)
- Extraction Unlocks: successful evac persists Codex entries + can unlock Phase routes, vendors, or POIs
- Team Assist: squadmates can carry your “memory core” to evac; betrayals possible

Dynamic Events

- Redaction Orders: Archivists lock categories; only stealth exfils count
- EMP Surges: Dead‑Sky spikes drain coherence; analog play recommended

Success Criteria

- Players feel extraction stakes beyond loot: knowledge, routes, and seasonal metagame
- Average 1–2 codex unlocks per successful mid‑tier run

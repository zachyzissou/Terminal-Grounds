## Truce Gate Governance

## Premise

- Numbered Truce Gates grant neutral passage. Violations trigger escalating, persistent penalties.

## Rules

- Tolls: dynamic by territory pressure; discounts by Warden rep
- Violations: firing inside gate zones, jamming, or arrest evasion
- Penalties: Warden manhunts, doubled tolls, loss of neutral services
- Redemption: reparations contracts; escort missions; community aid tasks

## Extraction Stakes

- Gate status affects evac route viability and timer compression
- Breaking truce yields short-term loot advantages but creates long-term friction

## System Hooks

- Territorial influence mod applied on violations
- Warden patrol density increases; scanners auto-flag offenders
- Vendors honor gate bans; convoy reroute costs rise

## Success Criteria

- 80% of players recognize and respect gates within 3 sessions
- Violations are meaningful but rarely soft-lock progression

**Count**: 3-8 districts per region (24-64 total)  
**Control Duration**: Days to weeks based on faction activity  
**Operational Impact**: Determines spawn locations, extraction routes, resource availability

**District Categories**:

- **Strategic Facilities**: High-value installations affecting regional control
- **Resource Nodes**: Salvage sites, equipment caches, intelligence sources
- **Population Centers**: Civilian areas requiring protection or evacuation
- **Infrastructure Hubs**: Power, communications, transportation networks
- **Contested Zones**: Actively disputed areas with shifting control
- **Neutral Territories**: Areas under temporary cease-fire or international oversight

#### Level 3: Control Points (Tactical Scale)

**Size**: 50-200 meter tactical objectives within districts  
**Count**: 2-6 control points per district (48-384 total)  
**Control Duration**: Hours to days based on operational activity  
**Tactical Impact**: Immediate gameplay benefits, spawn security, extraction access

**Control Point Types**:

### Influence System Mechanics

#### Influence Values (0-100 per faction per territorial unit)

- **0-20 (No Influence)**: No faction presence, neutral territory
- **21-40 (Minor Influence)**: Limited faction activity, contested status
- **41-60 (Moderate Influence)**: Significant presence, shared control possible
- **61-80 (Major Influence)**: Dominant presence, primary control
- **81-100 (Total Control)**: Exclusive control, maximum faction benefits

#### Multi-Faction Influence Resolution

- **Contested Control**: Multiple factions with 40+ influence share benefits/restrictions
- **Dominant Control**: Faction with 20+ influence advantage gains primary control
- **Exclusive Control**: Single faction with 80+ influence and others below 20
- **Neutral Status**: No faction exceeds 40 influence, neutral benefits apply

#### Influence Gain Mechanics

- **Objective Completion**: +5-15 influence based on objective significance
- **Control Point Capture**: +10-25 influence for tactical control point seizure
- **Defensive Success**: +5-10 influence for repelling faction attacks
- **Resource Extraction**: +2-8 influence for successful extraction from territory
- **Civilian Protection**: +5-20 influence for humanitarian operations
- **Intelligence Operations**: +3-12 influence for successful espionage

#### Influence Decay Mechanics

- **Natural Decay**: -1 influence per day without faction activity
- **Combat Losses**: -5-15 influence for failed operations in territory
- **Rival Operations**: -3-10 influence when competing factions succeed
- **Environmental Events**: -5-25 influence during uncontrolled environmental disasters
- **Civilian Casualties**: -10-30 influence for civilian harm in faction-controlled territory

# Terminal Grounds: Gameplay Design Document

## Chief Design Officer Specifications v1.0

### Executive Summary

Terminal Grounds will achieve Quadruple-A quality through faction-driven extraction gameplay that transforms rich lore into compelling moment-to-moment mechanics. Our core innovation: **Factional Territory Control** - an extraction system where faction allegiance drives objectives, combat style, and progression paths.

---

## Core Design Pillars

### 1. FACTION-DRIVEN IDENTITY

Every gameplay mechanic reflects faction philosophy and creates meaningful player identity choices.

### 2. TERRITORIAL STAKES

Extraction isn't just survival - it's advancing your faction's territorial control in the post-apocalyptic landscape.

### 3. ASYMMETRIC COOPERATION

Players must navigate uneasy alliances and conflicting objectives within the same operational area.

### 4. CONSEQUENCE PERSISTENCE

Player actions create lasting changes to world state, faction relationships, and available content.

**Districts**: Medium tactical areas within zones (specific facilities, neighborhoods)  
**Points**: Small operational objectives (buildings, checkpoints, resources)

### Control Mechanics

**Influence System**: Gradual territorial control through successful operations  
**Contested States**: Multiple factions can have partial influence in same area  
**Control Benefits**: Territorial control provides faction-specific advantages

- **Spawn Security**: Safer deployment in faction-controlled territory
- **Resource Access**: Better equipment/intel availability in friendly areas
- **Objective Efficiency**: Faction objectives easier in controlled territory
- **Extraction Options**: Additional extraction methods in stronghold areas

### Dynamic Territorial Events

**Faction Offensives**: Large-scale AI faction operations to claim territory  
**Alien Incursions**: Neutral threat forcing temporary faction cooperation  
**Resource Discoveries**: New territorial objectives triggering faction competition  
**Infrastructure Failures**: Territory becoming contested due to external events

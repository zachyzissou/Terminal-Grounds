# Terminal Grounds - Art Bible

## Visual Identity Framework
*Updated with Chief Art Director recommendations*

### Core Art Pillars

**PILLAR 1: GROUNDED MILITARISM** - Authentic military aesthetics with near-future tactical enhancement
**PILLAR 2: ENVIRONMENTAL SCARRING** - Landscapes physically wounded by exotic technology and endless conflict
**PILLAR 3: TECHNOLOGICAL STRATIFICATION** - Clear visual hierarchy from Field-grade to Monolith-tier equipment
**PILLAR 4: TRIBAL CORPORATE WARFARE** - Faction armies that brand territory through environmental marking
**PILLAR 5: EXTRACTION TENSION** - High-stakes escape scenarios with countdown architecture

### Core Aesthetic

**Grounded Military Sci-Fi** - A world where Field-grade military technology meets Monolith influence, creating a unique Splice aesthetic that feels both familiar and otherworldly. Every surface tells a story of conflict and survival.

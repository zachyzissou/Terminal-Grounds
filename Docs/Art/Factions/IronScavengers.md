# Iron Scavengers Faction Style Guide
*Renamed from Iron Vultures/VulturesUnion - Updated with Chief Art Director Framework*

Lore Reference: See canonical faction details in docs/Lore/LORE_BIBLE.md#factions

## Faction Identity

The Iron Scavengers are elite salvage specialists and equipment thieves who have perfected the art of battlefield acquisition and adaptive engineering. They transform stolen faction gear into unique hybrid systems, creating powerful but visually chaotic equipment that tells stories of conquest and survival.

## Enhanced Visual Philosophy

**Theft as Art** • **Adaptive Functionality** • **Victory Trophies**

The Iron Scavengers aesthetic emphasizes equipment that tells theft stories through visible modifications, mixed faction components, and asymmetrical compositions. Every piece of gear should clearly show its stolen origin while demonstrating the Scavenger's engineering ingenuity.

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors

- **Scavenger Orange**: `#D35400` - Warning markers, theft identification, hazard zones
- **Gunmetal Gray**: `#7F8C8D` - Base salvage metal, structural components
- **Trophy Gold**: `#F0C27B` - Accent color for prized salvage, victory markers

### Secondary Colors

- **Rust Brown**: `#8B4513` - Natural corrosion, aged metal surfaces
- **Mixed Faction Colors**: Various - Stolen equipment retains original faction colors as trophies

### Usage Guidelines

- Scavenger orange for primary identification and theft markers (35% coverage)
- Gunmetal gray for base structural and armor elements (30% coverage)
- Trophy gold for prized salvage and victory decorations (20% coverage)
- Mixed faction colors from stolen equipment (10% coverage)
- Rust brown for weathering and age indicators (5% coverage)

## Enhanced Material Motifs

### Trophy Equipment Integration

- **Signature Hook**: Every piece shows clear evidence of being stolen from other factions
- **Visual Storytelling**: Directorate serial numbers ground off, Free77 contract tags defaced
- **Asymmetrical Composition**: Mixed equipment creates unbalanced but functional silhouettes
- **Theft Markers**: Orange paint tags marking successful acquisitions

### Adaptive Engineering

- **Base Materials**: Welded salvage plates, stolen faction components, improvised connectors
- **Surface Treatments**: Orange theft markers over original faction colors
- **Wear Patterns**: Heavy modification marks, weld spatter, grinder marks from theft operations
- **Detail Elements**: Mixed fasteners, jury-rigged connections, trophy attachments

## Insignia and Iconography

### Primary Emblem

- **Symbol**: Asymmetrical scrap-metal claw grasping mixed faction symbols
- **Colors**: Scavenger orange claw on gunmetal field with trophy gold accents
- **Usage**: Welded onto stolen equipment, painted over faction markings
- **Asymmetrical Design**: Deliberately unbalanced composition showing chaotic acquisition

### Secondary Symbols

- **Theft Tallies**: Orange hash marks indicating successful equipment thefts
- **Victory Trophies**: Collected faction emblems displayed on vehicles and armor
- **Crew Signatures**: Personal welding marks and modification stamps
- **Warning Tags**: Improvised hazard markers using stolen faction materials

### Typography

- **Primary Font**: Hand-welded metal letters using salvaged materials
- **Secondary Font**: Stolen faction stencils modified with additional marks
- **Hierarchy**: Bold theft markers, standard identification, small specification notes

## Enhanced Silhouette Design Language

### Character Silhouettes

- **Asymmetrical Bulk**: Jury-rigged armor additions creating unbalanced profiles
- **Mixed Equipment**: Clearly visible different faction components on same character
- **Trophy Display**: Collected faction badges, tags, and equipment pieces
- **Functional Ugliness**: Form follows theft opportunity rather than aesthetic design

### Vehicle Silhouettes

- **Design Principles**: Base chassis with obviously stolen and integrated faction components
- **Proportions**: Unbalanced additions and modifications disrupting original lines
- **Details**: Orange theft tags, mixed faction armor plates, trophy displays

### Weapon Silhouettes

- **Characteristics**: Base platforms with clearly stolen faction attachments and modifications
- **Mixed Origins**: Directorate optics on Free77 platforms with Corporate Hegemony power cells
- **Condition**: Heavily modified, theft-scarred, functionally optimized

## Environmental Control Points

### Scrap-Metal Totems

- **Construction**: Built from defeated enemies' equipment and faction symbols
- **Composition**: Asymmetrical towers of stolen gear reaching skyward
- **Trophy Display**: Most prized thefts prominently featured at totem peaks
- **Territory Marking**: Orange paint marking Scavenger control zones

### Processing Centers

- **Layout**: Organized chaos focused on theft cataloging and equipment integration
- **Equipment**: Faction identification stations, modification workshops, trophy displays
- **Signage**: Orange theft markers with hand-welded crew identification tags

### Battlefield Evidence

- **Territory Control**: Orange spray-paint theft tags over faction markings
- **Acquisition Sites**: Clear evidence of equipment removal and processing
- **Victory Markers**: Scrap-metal monuments celebrating major theft operations

## Technology Integration Hierarchy

### Stolen Human-Tier Equipment

- **Aesthetic**: Original faction equipment with clear theft modifications
- **Reliability**: Enhanced through Scavenger engineering despite chaotic appearance  
- **Modification**: Orange theft tags, serial number removal, performance upgrades

### Hybrid Technology Theft

- **Integration**: Stolen faction hybrid systems jury-rigged into Scavenger platforms
- **Appearance**: Mixed technology with visible integration points and cooling modifications
- **Markings**: Orange theft tags over original faction certification labels

### Monolith Technology Acquisition

- **Approach**: Battlefield recovery and integration into stolen faction housings
- **Housing**: Monolith tech in modified stolen containers with orange warning markers
- **Safety**: Jury-rigged containment using best available stolen materials

## Audio Identity

- **Communication Style**: Salvage crew terminology, theft operation coordination
- **Equipment Sounds**: Mixed faction equipment creating unique audio signatures
- **Voice Characteristics**: Pride in theft expertise, competitive acquisition culture
- **Ambient Identity**: Workshop sounds of faction equipment being integrated and modified

## Environmental Storytelling Through Theft

### Faction Equipment Stories

- **Directorate Gear**: Serial numbers ground off, chevron markings defaced with orange
- **Free77 Equipment**: Contract numbers replaced with theft tallies
- **Corporate Hegemony Tech**: Corporate logos spray-painted over with Scavenger tags
- **Archive Keepers Artifacts**: Ancient texts covered with orange theft markers

### Victory Documentation

- **Trophy Collections**: Displays of successful theft operations on vehicles and armor
- **Crew Competition**: Individual theft tallies and personal trophy displays
- **Operation Records**: Hand-welded plaques commemorating major equipment acquisitions
